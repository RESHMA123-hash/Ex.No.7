# Aim: To develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT - To demonstrate how to create a prompt-based application to organize daily tasks, showing the progression from simple to more advanced prompt designs and their corresponding outputs.

#AI Tools Required: 


# Explanation: 
Prompt:
"Design a personal productivity assistant that can help manage daily tasks, schedule reminders, suggest wellness tips, and answer general queries. The assistant should interact using natural language and be adaptable to the user‚Äôs changing preferences over time."
Procedure:
1. Define the core requirements of a personal productivity assistant.
2. Identify and construct appropriate prompts for each task using an LLM (e.g., ChatGPT).
3. Simulate natural user interaction through a simple interface or command-line system.
4. Collect feedback or inputs from users and adapt responses accordingly.
5. (Optional) Integrate basic memory to simulate preference adaptation.
EXPECTED OUTPUT: - (attached the drive link)
Output (Example Response by LLM):
Personal Productivity Assistant Features:
1. Daily Task Manager:
o Accept tasks via natural language (e.g., "Remind me to call mom at 6 PM").
o Organize tasks by priority and deadline.
o Provide daily summaries and pending items.
2. Smart Scheduler:
o Schedule events and set reminders using contextual understanding.
o Notify user of overlapping appointments or free time slots.
3. Wellness Tips Generator:
o Suggest daily wellness advice (hydration, exercise, screen-time breaks).
o Adapt suggestions based on past user preferences and responses.
### Output
## 1. **Basic Prompt (Simple Task List)**

**Prompt:**
*"Make a to-do list for my day with 5 tasks."*

**Output (Example):**

1. Wake up and exercise for 20 minutes
2. Have breakfast and coffee
3. Attend office meeting at 10 AM
4. Complete project report by 2 PM
5. Call parents in the evening

## 2. **Intermediate Prompt (Prioritization + Time Slots)**

**Prompt:**
*"Organize my day with tasks, assign time slots, and mark them as High/Medium/Low priority."*

**Output (Example):**

* **7:00 ‚Äì 7:30 AM**: Morning exercise (High)
* **8:00 ‚Äì 8:30 AM**: Breakfast (Medium)
* **10:00 ‚Äì 11:00 AM**: Office meeting (High)
* **11:30 ‚Äì 2:00 PM**: Work on project report (High)
* **6:00 ‚Äì 6:30 PM**: Call parents (Low)
## 3. **Advanced Prompt (Smart Assistant ‚Äì with Deadlines & Reminders)**

**Prompt:**
*"Create a detailed daily plan with tasks, deadlines, short motivational tips, and reminders for hydration and breaks."*

**Output (Example):**

* **7:00 ‚Äì 7:30 AM**: Morning exercise üèÉ (Tip: Start small, consistency wins)
* **8:00 ‚Äì 8:30 AM**: Healthy breakfast ü•£
* **10:00 ‚Äì 11:00 AM**: Team meeting (Deadline: 11:00 AM) ‚è∞
* **11:30 ‚Äì 2:00 PM**: Write project report (Deadline: 2:00 PM, break after 1 hour)
* **2:00 ‚Äì 2:15 PM**: Hydration break üíß
* **6:00 ‚Äì 6:30 PM**: Call parents (Relax and connect ‚ù§Ô∏è)
## 4. **Pro-Level Prompt (Adaptive AI Task Manager)**

**Prompt:**
*"Act as my personal task manager. Take my inputs for tasks, estimate the time required, prioritize them using the Eisenhower Matrix (urgent vs. important), and generate a schedule. Adjust dynamically if I say a task is delayed."*

**Output (Example):**
**Eisenhower Matrix Classification:**

* Urgent + Important ‚Üí Project report (Due 2 PM)
* Important but Not Urgent ‚Üí Exercise, Call parents
* Urgent but Not Important ‚Üí Reply to pending emails
* Not Urgent + Not Important ‚Üí Browse social media

**Proposed Schedule:**

* **7:00 AM** ‚Äì Exercise (Important)
* **10:00 AM** ‚Äì Office meeting (Urgent + Important)
* **11:30 AM ‚Äì 2:00 PM** ‚Äì Project report (High priority)
* **3:00 PM** ‚Äì Emails (Quick task)
* **6:00 PM** ‚Äì Call parents (Connection task)

*(If user says "report delayed to tomorrow," AI automatically reschedules and reprioritizes.)*

üëâ This way, the demo shows the **progression of prompt engineering**:

* Start ‚Üí simple list
* Then ‚Üí add prioritization/time
* Next ‚Üí add motivation/reminders
* Finally ‚Üí adaptive, smart task manager
# Result: 
The corresponding Prompt is executed successfully.
